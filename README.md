Share some ‚ù§Ô∏è and star repo to support the [JSON Dart](https://github.com/signmotion/json_dart).

_If you write an article about **JsonDart** or any of [these](https://pub.dev/packages?q=publisher%3Asyrokomskyi.com&sort=updated) packages, let me know and I'll post the URL of the article in the **README**_ ü§ù

## üöÄ Usage

### Bluring Key Fields

```dart
print({'api_key': '12345-my-key-value'}.blured());
```

```json
{api_key: ******************}
```

### Keepeing Significant Fields Only

```dart
const json = <String, dynamic>{
  'null': null,
  'false_bool': false,
  'ok': true,
  'zero_int': 0,
  'positive_zero_double': 0.0,
  'negative_zero_double': -0.0,
  'empty_string': '',
  'empty_list': <int>[],
  'empty_map': <String, dynamic>{},
  'empty_set': <int>{},
};
print(json.jsonWithSignificantFields);
```

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

## üëã Welcome

If you encounter any problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/signmotion/json_dart/issues). If you feel the package is missing a feature, please [raise a ticket](https://github.com/signmotion/json_dart/issues) on Github and I'll look into it. Requests and suggestions are warmly welcome. Danke!

Contributions are what make the open-source community such a great place to learn, create, take a new skills, and be inspired.

If this is your first contribution, I'll leave you with some of the best links I've found: they will help you get started or/and become even more efficient.

- [Guide to Making a First Contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions). You will find the guide in your native language.
- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute). Longread for deep diving for first-timers and for veterans.
- [Summer Guide from Google](https://youtu.be/qGTQ7dEZXZc).
- [CodeTriangle](https://codetriage.com). Free community tools for contributing to Open Source projects.

The package **JsonDart** is open-source, stable and well-tested. Development happens on
[GitHub](https://github.com/signmotion/json_dart). Feel free to report issues
or create a pull-request there.

General questions are best asked on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/json_dart).

And here is a curated list of how you can help:

- Documenting the undocumented. Whenever you come across a class, property, or method within our codebase that you're familiar with and notice it lacks documentation, kindly spare a couple of minutes to jot down some helpful notes for your fellow developers.
- Refining the code. While I'm aware it's primarily my responsibility to refactor the code, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions you're willing to make in this area. Your insights and improvements are appreciated!
- Constructive code reviews. Should you discover a more efficient approach to achieve something, I'm all ears. Your suggestions for enhancement are invaluable.
- Sharing your examples. If you've experimented with our use cases or have crafted some examples of your own, feel free to add them to the `example` directory. Your practical insights can enrich our resource pool.
- Fix typos/grammar mistakes.
- Report bugs and scenarios that are difficult to implement.
- Implement new features by making a pull-request.

## ‚úÖ TODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **JsonDart**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- All feautures into `README`.
- The types from the package [pure_dart_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/pure_dart_ui).

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
